1x PCB
1x L298N DC motor driver (the square kind)
2x Arduino Pro Micro (NOT PRO MINI! Sparkfun makes these, but there are plenty of clones) 
1x filtering capacitor for the motor power if you think its nessissary.
a bunch of male and female pin headers
3x M3x20mm spacers w/screws and nuts
1x M3x5 screws with nuts
1x 3D printed "fanbracket.stl"
1x 40mm fan

If you are dealing with a lot of power, the drivers are stackable, and two pins are included for each control pin, so you dont need to splice wires for two drivers. However, you can theoretically stack these as high as you want and run them in parallel. Drivers can handle about 2 amps per channel.
